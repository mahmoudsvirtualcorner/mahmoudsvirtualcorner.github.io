    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
      Geometric structures such as points, lines, and surfaces play a vital role in scientific visualization.
      However, these visualizations frequently suffer from visual clutter that hinders the inspection of
      important features behind dense but less important features. In the past few years, geometric cluttering
      and occlusion avoidance has been addressed in scientific visualization with various approaches such as
      opacity optimization techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this paper, we present a novel approach for opacity optimization based on recent state-of-the-art
      moment-based techniques for signal reconstruction. In contrast to truncated Fourier series, moment-based
      reconstructions of feature importance and optical depth along view rays are highly accurate for sparse
      regions but also plausible for densely covered regions. At the same time, moment-based methods do not
      suffer from ringing artifacts. Moreover, this representation enables fast evaluation and compact storage,
      which is crucial for per-pixel optimization especially for large geometric structures.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also present a fast screen space filtering approach for optimized opacities that works directly on
      moment buffers. This filtering approach is suitable for real-time visualization applications, while
      providing comparable quality to object space smoothing. Its implementation is independent of the type
      of geometry such that it is general and easy to integrate. We compare our technique to recent state-of-the-art
      techniques for opacity optimization and apply it to real and synthetic datasets in various applications.
